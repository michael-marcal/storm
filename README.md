# Welcome to Storm!

## About
During the great Nor'Easter of January 2022, I was cooped up at home while the snow piled up outside.  I had been 
thinking about Inheritance versus Composition from a conversation that spawned at work.  Looking to 
play around with the concepts more deeply, I needed a subject to model.  Naturally, modeling a storm 
came to mind.

tests, automatically, via maven, use the following command:

in addition to the maven goals identified above.
